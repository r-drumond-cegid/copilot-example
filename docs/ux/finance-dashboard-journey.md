# User Journey: Daily Cash Review

## User Persona
- **Who**: Treasury manager at an Allmybanks client (multi‑bank, multi‑entity)
- **Goal**: Identify status, risks (overdrafts, FX), and actions in under 30 seconds
- **Context**: Laptop (13–15"); morning check‑in before payment cut‑offs; repeat daily
- **Success Metric**: Above‑the‑fold KPIs + exceptions; minimal scrolling; clear actions

## Journey Stages

### Stage 1: Awareness
**What user is doing**: Opens dashboard to review today’s balances and changes.
**What user is thinking**: "Show me totals and what changed since yesterday."
**What user is feeling**: ⏱ Time-pressured; wants clarity fast.
**Pain points**:
- Large hero block pushes details below fold.
- Date controls and presets clutter header.
- No visibility of bank cut‑off timers, approval backlog, or connectivity status.
**Opportunity**: Compact summary header; sticky single date‑range; delta badges; cut‑off timers; approvals summary.

### Stage 2: Exploration
**What user is doing**: Scans KPIs, checks min/max/avg, reviews overdraft exposure.
**What user is thinking**: "Is anything risky? What requires action?"
**What user is feeling**: 🧭 Needs quick prioritization.
**Pain points**:
- All metrics equal visual weight; hard to parse hierarchy.
- No quick insight/alerts module.
- Entity/bank grouping requires navigation away; cash pool status hidden.
**Opportunity**: KPI tiers (primary/secondary/tertiary); Quick Insights card with exceptions; bank/entity toggle; cash pool overview.

### Stage 3: Action
**What user is doing**: Opens trend chart; filters transactions; investigates anomalies.
**What user is thinking**: "Prove this change and identify causes."
**What user is feeling**: 🔎 Focused; wants efficient filters.
**Pain points**:
- Chart uses excessive height; gridlines dominate.
- Transaction table lacks progressive filtering and column priority.
- No saved filters for bank/entity; approvals and statuses mixed with regular transactions.
**Opportunity**: Chart height responsive (~30–40vh), brush/zoom, lighter grid; table density, priority columns, category chips, saved filters; approvals tab with counts.

### Stage 4: Outcome
**What user is doing**: Executes transfers or logs notes; confirms stability.
**What user is thinking**: "No surprises; actions documented."
**What user is feeling**: ✅ Confident.
**Success metrics**:
- Insight in <30s; actions in <2 min.
- Exceptions surfaced above the fold.
